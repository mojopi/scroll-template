        <h4>Oh The places you'll go!</h4>
        <p>Congratulations!<br>
            Today is your day.<br>
            You're off to Great Places!<br>
            You're off and away!<br><br>
            You have brains in your head.<br>
            You have feet in your shoes.<br>
            You can steer yourself any direction you choose.<br>
            You're on your own. And you know what you know.<br>
            And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.<br><br>
            You'll look up and down streets.<br>
            Look 'em over with care.<br>
            About some you will say, "I don't choose to go there."<br>
            With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet, <br>
            you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.<br><br>
            And you may not find any<br>
            you'll want to go down.<br>
            In that case, of course,<br>
            you'll head straight out of town.<br><br>
            It's opener there<br>
            in the wide open air.<br>
            Out there things can happen<br>
            and frequently do<br>
            to people as brainy<br>
            and footsy as you.<br><br>
            And then things start to happen,<br>
            don't worry. Don't stew.<br>
            Just go right along.<br>
            You'll start happening too.<br><br>

        <p>This Teenage Life is a podcast about the ideas, stories, and unique perspectives of teenagers in the middle of their own growth as humans. The episodes that you’ll hear, and the people that you’ll meet, are meant to be related to, laughed at, and most of all offer a connection to whoever is listening.</p>
        <p>For us, it's also a way to process what we feel and think. We all have our experiences. Sharing them with people we're comfortable with makes the world a little less big, and a little more loving.</p>

        <h4>The Soul of An Octopus</h4>

        <p>“A lion is a mammal like us; an octopus is put together completely differently, with three hearts, a brain that wraps around its throat, and a covering of slime instead of hair. Even their blood is a different color from ours; it’s blue, because copper, not iron, carries its oxygen.”</p>

        <h4>Where the Sidewalk Ends</h4>
        <p>There is a place where the sidewalk ends<br>
            And before the street begins,<br>
            And there the grass grows soft and white,<br>
            And there the sun burns crimson bright,<br>
            And there the moon-bird rests from his flight<br>
            To cool in the peppermint wind.<br><br>
            Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black<br>
            And the dark street winds and bends.<br>
            Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow<br>
            We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
            And watch where the chalk-white arrows go<br>
            To the place where the sidewalk ends.<br><br>
            Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
            And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,<br>
            For the children, they mark, and the children, they know<br>
            The place where the sidewalk ends.<br>
